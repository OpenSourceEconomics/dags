## Abstract

## Backwards compatibility

All changes are fully backwards compatible. We are adding new functions, not changing
existing ones.

## Motivation

dags constructs a graph based on function names, which need to be valid Python
identifiers. In larger projects, which distribute things across many submodules, this
will lead to very long and/or cryptic identifiers. Even in smaller projects, this may
happen if there are multiple similar submodules. E.g., in case of a library depicting a
taxes and transfers system, two different transfer programs will have many similar
concepts (eligibility criteria, benefits, ...). In case one wants to process a panel
dataset with dimensions year Ã— variables, often one will have to do this at a granular
level for some variables in some years, but for all years at the same time for other
variables. In both cases, disambiguation via string manipulations on the user side is
repetitive and error-prone. As a result, code becomes unmanageable.

Hence, programming languages such as Python have the concept of namespaces, which allows
for short identifiers with the scope provided by the broader context. The equivalent for
dags will be a nested dictionary of functions based on
[pybaum](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/pybaum), with the scope provided by a
branch of the tree.

Before going into detail, an example is useful.

## Example: Taxes and transfers system

Say we have the following structure:

```
taxes_transfers
|-- main.py
|   |-- monthly_earnings(hours, hourly_wage)
|   |-- functions (dict, see below)
|-- pensions.py
|   |-- eligible(benefits_last_period, applied_this_period)
|   |-- benefit(eligible, aime, conversion_factor, monthly_earnings, unemployment_insurance__earnings_limit)
|-- unemployment_insurance.py
|   |-- monthly_earnings(hours, hourly_wage, earnings_limit):
|   |-- eligible(benefits_last_period, applied_this_period, hours, monthly_earnings, hours_limit, earnings_limit)
|   |-- benefit(eligible, monthly_earnings, fraction)
```

### Content of pensions.py

```py
def eligible(
    benefits_last_period,
    applied_this_period,
):
    return True if benefits_last_period else applied_this_period


def benefit(
    eligible,
    aime,
    conversion_factor,
    monthly_earnings,
    unemployment_insurance__earnings_limit,
):
    cond = eligible and monthly_earnings < unemployment_insurance__earnings_limit
    return aime * conversion_factor if cond else 0
```

### Content of unemployment_insurance.py

```py
def monthly_earnings(hours, hourly_wage, earnings_limit):
    e = hours * 4.3 * hourly_wage
    return e if e < earnings_limit else earnings_limit


def eligible(
    benefits_last_period,
    applied_this_period,
    hours,
    monthly_earnings,
    hours_limit,
    earnings_limit,
):
    cond = (
        benefits_last_period or hours < hours_limit or monthly_earnings < earnings_limit
    )

    return False if cond else applied_this_period


def benefit(eligible, baseline_earnings, fraction):
    return baseline_earnings * fraction if eligible else 0
```

### Content of main.py

```py
import pensions
import unemployment_insurance


def monthly_earnings(hours, hourly_wage):
    return hours * 4.3 * hourly_wage


functions = {
    "monthly_earnings": monthly_earnings,
    "pensions": {
        "eligible": pensions.eligible,
        "benefit": pensions.benefit,
    },
    "unemployment_insurance": {
        "eligible": unemployment_insurance.eligible,
        "benefit": unemployment_insurance.benefit,
    },
}


targets = {"pensions": ["benefit"], "unemployment_insurance": ["benefit"]}


input_structure = {
    "pensions": {
        "aime": None,
        "conversion_factor": None,
        "benefits_last_period": None,
        "applied_this_period": None,
    },
    "unemployment_insurance": {
        "benefits_last_period": None,
        "applied_this_period": None,
        "hours_limit": None,
        "earnings_limit": None,
    },
    "hours": None,
    "hourly_wage": None,
}

```

## New functions

```py
concatenate_functions_tree(
  functions,
  targets,
  input_structure,
  mode="tree",  # Literal["tree", "flat"]
  name_clashes="raise",  # Literal["raise", "warn", "ignore"]
  enforce_signature=True,
)
```

```py
create_input_structure_tree(
  functions,
  targets,
  level_of_inputs,  # Literal["top", "bottom"]
  mode="tree",  # Literal["tree", "flat"]
)
```

## The `functions` argument in the "tree" functions

### Possible Containers

- pybaum Registry: We only allow arbitrarily nested dictionaries with functions as
  leaves
- Hence, no unlabeled datastructures are possible.
- Only exception _might_ be to enable providing a module directly instead of a
  dictionary of functions. The module name would be the outermost node of the branch,
  the functions in it would become leaves. However, it is unclear whether we'd want all
  functions imported in that module to show up in the graph or only the ones **def**ined
  in it.

  In any case, this would only be implemented in a second step, probably easier to put a
  helper recipe on the website.

### Argument names

- When can we use short and long names for arguments
- Are there ever ambiguous cases and if so, how are they handled? How does this relate
  to Python's resolution of scopes?
- What should not work (e.g. because it would be error prone)

**Use more abstract examples than tax and transfer here!**

```
abstract
|-- __init__.py
|   |-- a(b, c)
|   |-- [call of concatenate_functions]
|-- x.py
|   |-- f(a, b)
|   |-- g(f, c)
|-- y.py
|   |-- a(b, c)
|   |-- m(x__f, a, b)
```

## Inputs of the concatenated function

- Is it necessary to have different input modes (e.g. flat and nested) or is nested
  always what we want?
- input of `x__c` should inherit behavior of .

## Output of the concatenated function

- Is it necessary to have different output formats (e.g. flat and nested) or should this
  be done outside of dags?

## Implementation Ideas

- How aware should the dag be of the nesting? It is probably possible to flatten
  everything before a dag is built but then we lose information that could be useful for
  visualization.
- It is generally easy to flatten the function container. The hard part is converting
  the function arguments into long names that are globally unique in the dag!
- **What can we learn from pytask? Essentially pytask has this already!**
